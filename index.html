    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am an electronics and robotics engineer with a passion for creating innovative and cutting-edge solutions. I have a strong background in both hardware and software development, and I am always looking for new challenges.</p>
    <p>In my previous role at Google, I worked on the development of a new robotic arm that is now being used in manufacturing facilities around the world. I am also the founder of a startup company that is developing a new type of wearable sensor that can be used to track health data.</p>
    <p>I am a highly motivated and results-oriented individual who is always willing to go the extra mile. I am confident that I can make a significant contribution to your team.</p>
